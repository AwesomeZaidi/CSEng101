# UIC Eng101

At the University of Illinois at Chicago in My Engineering Orientation Course we divided the class into all of our seperate majors and we had 10 minutes to present to the rest of the classrooom what our major is all about. In light of being a true computer science advocate, I decided we not use Power Point and actually code our presentation for the class.

So within 10 minutes, I had to find and download an appropriate free bootstrap template, edit the text to display our content, push to GitHub and present to the class. Least to say, we got an A.
